# Travel List App

A React app that searches for Country/Capital, getting results from REST Countries API (https://restcountries.com/).

## Features 

* Checking an item adds to saved destinations, which persists using local storage. 
* Shift + click will select multiple saved items, in either direction. 
* Deselecting items works using the same method.
* Selected items can be deleted which updates the main page by showing they are no longer within the saved destinations.
